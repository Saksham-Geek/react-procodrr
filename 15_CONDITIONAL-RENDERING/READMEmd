# Conditional Rendering in React

Conditional rendering is a fundamental concept in React that allows you to render different content or components based on certain conditions. It's essentially about applying some condition and then rendering something accordingly.

## What is Conditional Rendering in React?

- Conditional rendering means showing or hiding elements or components on the user interface based on whether a specific condition is met.
- It can be applied to small things like text or to entire components.
- You can wrap any part of your code or even a whole component inside a condition to control its rendering.

## How to Implement Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering in React is typically done using standard JavaScript features within your JSX. The sources mention using JavaScript logic, specifically the ternary operator and the logical AND (&&) operator.

### **Using the Ternary Operator (? :)**

The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional expressions. It allows you to render one thing if a condition is true and another thing if it's false.

- **Structure**: `condition ? renderThisIfTrue : renderThisIfFalse`.
- You check if a condition is true.
- If the condition is true, it will return the value or component after the `?`.
- If the condition is false, it will return the value or component after the `:`.
  
**Example:** Checking if `appleCount` is equal to 10. If true, show `"full"`; otherwise, show `"not full"`. You can extend this, for example, checking if `appleCount` is 0, show `"empty"`; otherwise, show something else or nothing.

### **Using the Logical AND Operator (&&)**

The logical AND operator is often used for conditionally rendering something only when a condition is true, and rendering nothing otherwise.

- **Structure**: `condition && renderThisIfTrue`.
- This operator checks the first part, which is the condition.
- If the condition (the first value) is true, it returns the second value (the thing you want to render).
- If the condition (the first value) is false, it returns the first value, which is `false`.

**Important:** React does not show certain values on the page, including `false`, `true`, `undefined`, and `null`. Because the `&&` operator returns `false` when the condition is false, nothing is rendered in that case.

- This is useful when you only want to render something if a condition is true, and simply render nothing if it's false.
- If you explicitly want to show `false`, `null`, etc., as text on the page, you would need to put them inside a string (e.g., `"false"`).

## Examples and Use Cases

Conditional rendering is used in numerous scenarios in React applications:

- **Displaying Text Based on Value:** Showing `"full"` when an apple count reaches 10 or `"empty"` when it's 0, and showing nothing in between.
- **Rendering Different Components:** Showing one component if a condition is true and a different component if it's false (using the ternary operator `? :`).
- **Displaying Content Based on State:** Showing a "login" button if a user is not logged in, or a "logout" button (or a user icon related to their profile) if they are logged in. This is a very common use case.
- **Showing Partial Status:** Displaying `"half full"` if a value is greater than or equal to 5.
- **Conditional rendering** is a fundamental technique used in many other cases.

## JavaScript Concepts

Understanding certain JavaScript concepts is helpful for conditional rendering in React:

- **Ternary Operator:** How `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse` works.
- **Logical AND Operator (&&):** How `value1 && value2` evaluates, especially its behavior with truthy and falsy values.
  
These are core JavaScript features, not React-specific syntax.

## Summary

Conditional rendering in React is the practice of displaying different UI elements or components based on conditions. This is achieved using standard JavaScript logic within JSX, primarily the ternary operator (`? :`) for choosing between two different outputs (true or false) and the logical AND operator (`&&`) for rendering something only when a condition is true. React automatically handles not displaying values like `false`, `true`, `undefined`, and `null`, which is leveraged by the `&&` operator. Conditional rendering is useful for a wide range of applications, from simple text changes based on values to displaying different buttons or entire components depending on application state like user login status.
